                    <p>At Medina and Maret Interstellar Engineering, it is our highest priority to make your
                        travel across the galaxy as comfortable, efficient, and affordable as possible.
                        Our starships are outrageously inexpensive for their high quality.
                        Or if your one of those people who like spending, we have technologies that our competitors
                        can only dream of! You can try out our new cutting-the-fabric-of-reality-edge modules,
                        and travel the universe and defy the laws of physics at the same time!</p>
